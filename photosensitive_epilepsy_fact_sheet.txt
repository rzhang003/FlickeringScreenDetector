this sheet outlines common triggers for photosensitive epilepsy


according to epilepsy.org.uk:

- "People with photosensitive epilepsy are affected by lights that have different flash or flicker rates from as low as 3 to as high as 60 per second. 
Lights that flash or flicker between 16 and 25 times a second are the most likely to trigger seizures."

- "Content shared online and on social media platforms could trigger seizures if it contains flashing imagery or has animated patterns.
This could be in videos, GIFs, or animated backgrounds used in video conferencing systems such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. On many online and social media platforms, 
it’s possible to turn off the ‘auto-play’ feature for videos and GIFs."

- "Patterns can trigger seizures. They include:
    High contrast patterns such as black and white stripes
    Striped or patterned materials and walls
    Patterns in some television programmes, video or electronic games
    A moving escalator"

- "The blades of some ceiling fans can rotate at a fast speed. Looking at light through them could trigger a seizure. Large wind turbines have blades which rotate at a rate that is unlikely to trigger a seizure. Smaller turbines can rotate at a faster rate. 
When these smaller turbines create a shadow and/or flicker effect with the sun, they could trigger a seizure."


- "Screen images with bright, high contrast colours can be more likely to trigger a seizure. See below for some suggestions of how to reduce the risk."


- "Looking directly at certain patterns caused by sunlight could be a seizure trigger for some people. Examples of these situations are:
    Sunlight through slatted blinds
    Sunlight through trees, viewed from a moving vehicle
    Sunlight reflected off moving water or off snow
    Sunlight through moving leaves
    Sunlight through railings, as you move past them"
